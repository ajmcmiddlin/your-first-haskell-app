# Motivation

## Getting started is hard

##

How do you apply concepts to a real application?

##

How do I find which packages to use and how to use them?

##

How do I setup a project?

## Myths

##

Haskell isn't for writing "normal" applications.

##

Haskell is too hard to use for my application.
