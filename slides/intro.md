<!--
I thought I needed to learn a huge number of concepts to write something useful - e.g.

 - lens
 - Monad Transformers / classy mtl
-->

##

Write the code!

<!--
 - Turns out you don't need them.
 - Writing something is a great way to learn/solidify
 - Motivates learning new concepts
-->

##

Working examples 

<!--
I benefitted greatly from having a template/example to work from.
Code and slides available on Github
-->

## Assumed knowledge
